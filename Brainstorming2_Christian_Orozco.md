# **MileStone 2 Group Project**

### General Ideas:

- Would like the app to persist
- Definitely a login screen
- Connect to some API for data exchange?
- Database Storage of data
- Ability to erase/update comments?
- How about media i.e. pictues, video? (Maybe to complex)
    


>This app overall should be something scalable if necessary, hopefully can take care of a need that is not being taken care of or not much out there to choose from.    <br/>
>**By the end of this Milestone we need to have 3 final picked app and list the following:** 

- What is the app for
- Who is the app for
- Why are we building this app
- Challenges

## App Ideas

1. MyCocktail App
    - Search Cocktails in general
    - Insert ingredients to retrieve what can be made with them
    - Option to store selected drinks

2. Youtube Nerd Statistics App
    - Ability to see general statistics of Youtube Channels
    - Compare statistics from other channels?

3. My Dog Friendly Map App
    - Map where users can mark where it is Dog Friendly
    - Maybe even shows where there are dog bathroom accidents (User updated)? 

4. Book Favorites App
    - Search through a book library
    - Tap on books you wish to read later or are currently reading
    - Feed shows a list of books the user might like (Based on what they bookmarked)

5. Random Ideas App
    - AI that provides ideas to users who can't come up with an idea
    - Users can give details to what kind of subject they would be interested getting ideas for
    - Provides pros and cons for the ideas they are pursuing



## Apps to be seriously considered:

1. MyCocktail App
    ***What:*** Primary function of this app would be for enternainment and some adult fun.  Will be able to search cocktails to make via ingredients or overal liquor selected.<br/>
    
    ***Who:*** This app is for adults 21 years and over to enjoy responsibly.<br/>
    
    ***Why:*** This app will be built mainly for responsible entertainment and creative purposes (Possibly seeing what drinks can be made from random ingredients).<br/>
    
    ***Challenges:*** We believe the challenge for this app is in its uniqueness; either it is going to be liked, or no one will pay much attention.
    
    
    
2. My Dog Friendly Map App
    ***What:*** An app that allows users to mark on a map where it is dog friendly <br/>
    
    ***Who:*** This app is primarily for dog owners <br/>
    
    ***Why:*** This app will make it easier for people to find locations their dog can visit <br/>
    
    ***Challenges:*** Moderating the locations and ensuring that the location is in fact dog friendly, creating a UI that lets user easily pin a location <br/>
    
    
3. Random Ideas App
    ***What:*** An app that gives users ideas to whatever kind of niche they are interested in working <br/>
    
    ***Who:*** This app is for people who can't come up with unique ideas<br/>
    
    ***Why:*** Most ideas have already been done or out of scope, this AI will give ideas that are unique and doable<br/>
    
    ***Challenges:*** Training an AI model and using a database would be costly and time consuming<br/>
